            <h1>The History of Bath</h1>
            
            <div class="texthistory">
            <h3>Celtic Times</h3>
            <p> Bath was founded by Bladud, the eldest son of the legendary King Lud. 
                Among the most significant Celtic works of art of Roman Europe is the outstanding sun god's head that welcomed pilgrims to the temple of Sulis Minerva in Bath.  
                Although Bath was in fact built nearly 1,000 years after Bladud, it was without doubt a major Celtic place of power. 
                The hills around Bath such as Bathampton Down saw human activity from the Mesolithic period. 
                Several Bronze Age round barrows were opened by John Skinner in the 18th century. 
                Bathampton Camp may have been an Iron Age hill fort or stock enclosure.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Roman Times</h3>
                <p>The Romans had a genius for appropriating local deities and blending them with their own gods. 
                    So, Sul became Sulis Minerva when they built their temple where the druids grove had stood. 
                    Sul, goddess of arcane prophecy, was tempered with the cultured arts and science of Minerva. 
                    Although still mostly buried under magnificent Georgian streets, the Roman ruins in Bath are unsurpassed in Britain .<br>

                    The Romans started building their great baths and temple at the sacred spring soon after the Conquest, in the middle of the 1st Century AD. 
                    They named their city Aque Sulis and soon transformed the Celtic druids grove into one of the major therapeutic centres of the West. The Romans revered the Spring just as the Celts had done; by the 3rd century its stunning temple and luxurious baths attracted pilgrims from throughout the Roman world. Messages to her scratched onto metal, known as curse tablets, have been recovered from the Sacred Spring by archaeologists. 
                    These curse tablets were written in Latin, and usually laid curses on people by whom the writer felt they had been wronged. 
                    For example, if a citizen had his clothes stolen at the baths, he would write a curse, naming the suspects, on a tablet to be read by the Goddess Sulis Minerva.</p></div>
